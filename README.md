# PhoActionRPG

This repo is a reconfiguration of [this Epic tutorial project](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/slug/action-rpg), with a main focus asserting file structure & asset naming outlined in Phosphor's [style guide](https://github.com/PhoGroot/PhoStyleGuide). As many unused assets were deleted as possible. Any assets that had dependencies that were too complicated to bother unwinding were moved into a plugin folder at the base of the project's content directory.
